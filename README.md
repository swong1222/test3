# test3
Currently there are too many Git repositiories and the number is growing; making it hard for us to manage all the project build dependencies. To solve this problem we agreed to consolidate all the shared/common repositories into one. The strategy is to create a single shared repository, and slowy migragte each repo (one by one) to it.   This "shared" repo will be part of the CI build, and all the other "Module" builds will reference the lib in the "shared" repo.  For each repo that is not a module or process - it will either move inside the relevant module repo or it will move to the inside the new shared repo.
